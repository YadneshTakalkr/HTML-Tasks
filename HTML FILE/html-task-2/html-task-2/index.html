        <h1> News </h1>
        New Delhi: The Supreme Court on August 25, Thursday, noted that the technical committee appointed to investigate whether Indian law enforcement authorities had procured and used Pegasus, a military-grade Israeli spyware product, had found ‘malware’ in five out of the 29 devices submitted to it. The bench also noted that the Union government “did not cooperate” with the expert committee.

A bench of the CJI, Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, however, said that the committee found no conclusive proof of whether Pegasus was the malware used in the examined phones.
